# Classification of Chicken Coccidiosis Using Fecal Images: By Deep Learning

This project uses deep learning to classify chicken coccidiosis from fecal images. It includes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained in Google Colab and a web application built with Anvil for user-friendly inference.

## Features
- CNN model for classifying coccidiosis (e.g., positive/negative or severity levels).
- Web app for uploading fecal images and viewing predictions.
- Documentation for model training and deployment.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sohaib-kashif-97/Chicken-S--t-Detector-with-VGG19.git
   ```

2. Install Images from Kaggle: The Images for Chicken Feces is entirely open-source. It allows us a knowledge base for our Deep Learning to identify ROIs in Images and classify healthy and unhealthy feces.
